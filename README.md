# Horiseon Social Media Marketing Webpage
## User story.
For this project, I have been given a html code to debug. The purpose of this project was to ensure the HTML and Css documents followed a systematic structure to make it accessible to the viewer and functions ran efficiently. 

When opening the page on live server, I notice couple of malfunctions. The webpage title was missing and  certain fonts were not consistant with the flow of the page. I oepned the HTML doc provided and start by adding a title to the website url. Pulling the linked CSS stylesheet, I condensed certain classes and id's to declutter the code itself. I double checked that the functions corresponded to the atributes given in the Html sheet. I added alternative attribute to the images incase the source of the images happened to get lost with a text replacement. Once the CSS was condensed I labeled and what each class/id fuction was used for to make it more accessible to the reader. Lastly I esured the navigation links corresponded properly to their function.
